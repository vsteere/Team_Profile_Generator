# Team Profile Generator

This project uses node.js and jest testing to create a team profile html document through a CLI application using the inquirer prompts and jest testing. 

The user has the option to enter as many employees as they want using the three different role prompts. Each prompt is customized to ask for specific information, i.e. intern asks for the school name; engineer asks for the GitHub profile; and the manager asks for the office phone number. 

To run this application the jest and inquirer packages must be installed within the directory.

## Technologies Used
Inquirer package, jest testing package, node.js
